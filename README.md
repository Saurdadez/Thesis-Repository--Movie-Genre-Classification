## ðŸš€ Deployment

The model is deployed as a Flask web service. Users can upload background music clips, and the service returns the predicted movie genre.

To run locally:

```bash
cd app
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python app.py
| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1-Score |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | -------- |
| MLFNN + MFCC          | 79%      | 78%       | 77%     | 77%      |
| **CNN + MLFNN + Mel** | **89%**  | **88%**   | **89%** | **88%**  |
ðŸ§ª Dataset
A balanced dataset with 6000 samples (1000 per genre). Each sample is a 10-second audio clip extracted from background scores of various movies.

ðŸ“Œ Note: We used custom audio segmentation and ensured genre purity.
